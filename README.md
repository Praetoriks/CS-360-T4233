Inventory Tracker

**1. Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?**

The requirements and goals of the inventory tracking mobile application I was tasked with creating were to provide users with a simple and efficient way to track their inventory, manage their stock levels, and receive notifications when items reach a certain threshold, 0 items left in this case. The application includes a database with two tables: one to store inventory items and one to store user login information.

**2. What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?**

To support the user needs expressed to us at the beginning of the project, I included a login screen that allows users to create a new account or log in to an existing one. Once logged in, the app displays a grid view of all inventory items. Users can add or remove items from the inventory and adjust the quantity of specific items using intuitive mechanisms. The app includes a notification system that alerts users when the quantity of any item in the inventory reaches zero. This system ensures that users are aware of low stock levels and can take action to restock before items run out.

**3. How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?**

I approached the process of coding as something of a stop gap to make the systems we had envisioned previously into a reality. This is the first time I’ve ever approached a project from the visual appeal perspective before doing any sort of programming. In some ways it felt somewhat jarring as it caused us to approach the project from a functionality as a secondary aspect instead of a primary one. I don’t think I would do it this way again, but in general I feel that all of the skills are transferrable to any work we may do in the future as it taught us how to quickly learn a new IDE and utilize its internal aspects to bring an app to fruition in a very small period of time.

**4. How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?**

The application was tested using manual testing. Manual testing involved running the app on multiple Android devices to ensure that it worked correctly across different screen sizes and resolutions. The application was also designed with a user-centered UI, featuring a simple and intuitive layout that makes it easy for users to navigate and interact with the app. This made testing far easier than I originally assumed it would be as I was able to quickly make changes and see them play out on the phone emulator that we were using, seconds later. The process of testing is vital to producing any kind of product, nobody wants to use or pay for an annoying waste of space on their phone. As consumers we’ve come to expect a certain amount of quality in applications, and if we don’t have them then we simply won’t use the application.

**5. Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?**

Considering all of the components in the full app design and development process, I would say I had to innovate the most when it came to the database management systems as I don’t have much experience with using SQL. This involved a lot of reading documentation and figuring out how the system worked from the ground up.

**6. In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?**

One of the most successful components of the application, in my opinion, was the database management system, which allowed for efficient storage and retrieval of inventory data. By implementing a well-structured database schema, I was able to ensure that data was organized and accessible to the app's features, such as adding and removing items from inventory, and sending notifications to users when inventory levels reached a certain threshold.
